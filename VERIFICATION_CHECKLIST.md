- [ ] Test with correct password - should proceed
- [ ] Submit button works
- [ ] Progress indicators display
- [ ] Results are shown correctly

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Cloud Run Service Status
```bash
gcloud run services describe 5tran --region us-central1
```
- [ ] Service status is "Ready"
- [ ] Revision is serving traffic
- [ ] All 4 environment variables are set (ACCESS_PASSWORD, FIVETRAN_API_SECRET_BASE64, FIRECRAWL_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY)
- [ ] Memory allocation is correct (2Gi)
- [ ] CPU allocation is correct (2 vCPU)
- [ ] Timeout is set (3600s)

### Check Logs
```bash
gcloud run services logs read 5tran --region us-central1 --limit 50
```
- [ ] No startup errors
- [ ] Application initialized successfully
- [ ] Gradio server started
- [ ] No import errors
- [ ] No missing environment variables

### Resource Monitoring
- [ ] Check Cloud Console for service metrics
- [ ] Verify memory usage is within limits
- [ ] Check CPU utilization
- [ ] Monitor request latency
- [ ] Review error rate (should be 0%)

### Security Verification
- [ ] Service runs as non-root user
- [ ] Environment variables not exposed in logs
- [ ] HTTPS enabled by default
- [ ] Consider: Authentication required? (if needed)
- [ ] Consider: VPC connector? (if needed)

## Functional Testing

### Test Connector Generation
- [ ] Fill in all required fields
- [ ] Submit a test connector generation
- [ ] Monitor progress indicators
- [ ] Wait for completion
- [ ] Verify success or failure message
- [ ] Check generated output

### Error Handling
- [ ] Test with missing fields
- [ ] Test with invalid API keys (optional)
- [ ] Verify error messages display correctly
- [ ] Confirm application doesn't crash

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing (Optional)
- [ ] Test with concurrent requests
- [ ] Monitor auto-scaling behavior
- [ ] Check response times
- [ ] Verify no timeouts
- [ ] Monitor memory usage under load

### Scaling Verification
- [ ] Service scales to zero when idle
- [ ] Cold start time is acceptable
- [ ] Service scales up on demand
- [ ] Max instances respected

## Cost Verification

### Initial Checks
- [ ] Check Cloud Console billing page
- [ ] Verify service scales to zero
- [ ] No unexpected charges
- [ ] Resource allocation matches requirements

### Cost Optimization
- [ ] Min instances set to 0
- [ ] Max instances set appropriately (10)
- [ ] Memory not over-allocated
- [ ] CPU not over-allocated

## Rollback Plan

In case of issues:

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# List revisions
gcloud run revisions list --service 5tran --region us-central1

# Rollback to previous revision
gcloud run services update-traffic 5tran \
  --to-revisions PREVIOUS_REVISION=100 \
  --region us-central1
```
- [ ] Previous revision identified
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested
- [ ] Traffic routing works

### Complete Cleanup (if needed)
```bash
# Delete service
gcloud run services delete 5tran --region us-central1

# Delete images
gcloud container images delete gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/5tran --quiet
```
- [ ] Cleanup procedure documented
- [ ] Backup of working configuration

## Documentation Verification

- [ ] README.md updated with deployment info
- [ ] DEPLOYMENT.md is comprehensive
- [ ] QUICKSTART.md covers common tasks
- [ ] CONTAINER_SUMMARY.md describes architecture
- [ ] All commands in docs are tested and working

## Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Checks
- [ ] Monitor service health weekly
- [ ] Review logs for errors
- [ ] Check for dependency updates
- [ ] Update uv.lock when needed
- [ ] Rebuild and redeploy for security updates

### Update Procedure
1. [ ] Test changes locally
2. [ ] Update version/tag
3. [ ] Build new image
4. [ ] Deploy to staging (if exists)
5. [ ] Deploy to production
6. [ ] Monitor for issues
7. [ ] Keep previous revision ready for rollback

## Success Criteria

âœ… **Deployment is successful if:**
- Container builds without errors
- Application starts and runs correctly
- Gradio UI is accessible via HTTPS
- All features work as expected
- No errors in logs
- Service scales properly
- Costs are reasonable

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Container fails to build
- Check Dockerfile syntax
- Verify all COPY paths exist
- Ensure uv.lock is up to date

### Issue: Application won't start
- Check environment variables
- Review logs for import errors
- Verify PORT is set correctly

### Issue: Timeout errors
- Increase timeout in deploy command
- Check for long-running operations
- Consider increasing CPU/memory

### Issue: Out of memory
- Increase memory allocation
- Check for memory leaks
- Review connector generation process

### Issue: Cold starts too slow
- Consider setting min-instances > 0
- Optimize container size
- Review startup time

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check logs: `gcloud run services logs read 5tran --limit 100`
2. Review [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) troubleshooting section
3. Verify all checklist items are completed
4. Test locally to isolate issues
5. Check Cloud Console for service status
